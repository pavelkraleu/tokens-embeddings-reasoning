The Saturn V, a now-retired super heavy-lift launch vehicle from the United States, was created by NASA for the Apollo program, aimed at sending humans to explore the Moon. This rocket, which was certified for carrying humans, consisted of three stages and utilized liquid fuel for power. Between 1967 and 1973, it carried out nine manned missions to the Moon and was also responsible for deploying Skylab, America's first space station.
As of the year 2023, Saturn V stands as the sole launch vehicle to have transported humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). It is notable for having launched the heaviest payload and for having the most substantial payload capacity to low Earth orbit at 311,152 lb (141,136 kg). This capacity includes the third stage and the unburned propellant required for propelling the Apollo command and service module, along with the Lunar Module towards the Moon.
Saturn V, the most significant model in the Saturn rocket family, was engineered under Wernher von Braun's leadership at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, with Boeing, North American Aviation, Douglas Aircraft Company, and IBM serving as the primary contractors. Fifteen flight-capable Saturn V rockets were constructed, in addition to three for ground tests. Thirteen of these rockets were launched from the Kennedy Space Center without any loss of crew or cargo. From December 1968 (Apollo 8) to December 1972 (Apollo 17), a total of 24 astronauts were sent to the Moon aboard these rockets.
